# Hi there! 👋 I'm John Newman

**Swift/iOS Developer** | Passionate about Apple ecosystems and world-changing code

## 🚀 What I'm Up To

- **<span style="font-size: 20em;">🔭</span> Currently @ Little Legends**  
  I’m currently working with Little Legends, an interactive comic app start-up that pairs with a physical comic book. It aims to assist children in learning and understanding their emotions through fun, gamified visuals and ideas.

- **<span style="font-size: 5em;">👽</span> Current Build: Cosmidex**  
  I'm building and improving an app called Cosmidex to help the public discover all currently speculated existing alien species, and types of crafts said to have been reverse-engineered by both the US Govt, and/or the global elite, whichever term you prefer.

- **<span style="font-size: 5em;">🙆🏻‍♂️</span> Past Build: Bad Timing**  
  I also built a stretching app called Bad Timing, to make stretching more accessible and easier to start immediately. A no-fuss stretching companion to help improve stretching habits, even if it's bad timing. Open the app and enjoy the 'one-tap' start to get stretching.

## 🌱 Always Evolving

- I’m always learning how to work more efficiently with Swift and SwiftUI
- I keep updated on the latest releases and topics in Swift
- I love being on the forefront of modern app creation
- I'm interested in high-impact apps that nudge the world toward kindness, curiosity, and cosmic awareness ☄️
