# Hi there! 👋 I'm John Newman

**Swift/iOS Developer** | Building apps that spark curiosity, teach empathy, and stretch minds (literally) | Passionate about Apple ecosystems and world-changing code

## 🚀 What I'm Up To

- **🔭 Currently @ Little Legends**  
  Crafting an interactive comic app that syncs with physical books to help kids navigate emotions through gamified adventures. Think: Superhero stories meets emotional intelligence—because every legend starts with feeling seen.

- **👽 Side Quest: Cosmidex**  
  An app decoding the universe's mysteries! Users explore speculated alien species and reverse-engineered crafts (US Gov or global elite—your conspiracy flavor). Built with SwiftUI for seamless, otherworldly scrolling.

- **🙆🏻‍♂️ Past Build: Bad Timing**  
  A no-fuss stretching companion to kickstart wellness habits. Simple taps, guided flows, and reminders that make "I'll do it later" a thing of the past. (Pro tip: Stretch now—your future self says thanks.)

## 🌱 Always Evolving

- Mastering Swift & SwiftUI for buttery-smooth UIs that feel alive.  
- Dreaming big: High-impact apps that nudge the world toward kindness, curiosity, and cosmic awareness. One commit at a time. ☄️

> "Code is poetry, but the best poems change the world." – Me, probably.
