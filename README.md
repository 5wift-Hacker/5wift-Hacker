## Hi there 👋

My name is John, and I'm a trained Swift / iOS front-end developer interested in all Apple development platforms!

- 🔭 I’m currently working with Little Legends, an interactive comic app start-up that pairs with a physical comic book. It aims to assist children in learning and understanding their emotions through fun, gamified visuals and ideas.
  
- 👽 I recently built (and am continually improving) an app called Cosmidex to help the public discover all currently speculated existing alien species, and types of crafts said to have been reverse-engineered by both the US Govt, and/or the global elite, whichever term you prefer.

- 🙆🏻‍♂️ I also built a stretching app called Bad Timing, to make stretching more accessible and easier to start immediately.
  
- 🌱 I’m currently always learning how to more efficiently work with Swift and SwiftUI.

- ☄️ My biggest interests lie in changing the world, one line of code at a time! I love high-impact projects that help change the world for the better.
